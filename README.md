[//]: # (The interface may vary depending on the user's operating system.)

[//]: # (Below is the interface when the plugin is used on Linux Mint 22.)

[//]: # (## ImageJ Plugin instructions:)

[//]: # (### Prerequisites and installation:)

[//]: # (1. If Fiji is not installed, download and install a version, preferably bundled with JRE 1.8 &#40;https://imagej.net/software/fiji/&#41;.)

[//]: # (   If you already have Fiji installed, ensure it uses Java 1.8 or later.)

[//]: # (2. Download the [SMP_based_Max.zip]&#40;https://github.com/AnhMinhDo/SMPBasedMax/releases/download/v0.1.2-beta/SMP_based_Max.zip&#41; file)

[//]: # (3. Place the .jar file in the "plugins" folder of your Fiji installation)

[//]: # (4. Open Fiji)

[//]: # (### Usage:)

[//]: # (1. From Plugins menu in Fiji, choose SMP_based_Max; The plugin dialog  will be displayed)

[//]: # (2. Choose SINGLE_FILE Mode for single .tiff file processing, MULTIPLE_FILES Mode for batch processing or Interactive for tuning parameters)

[//]: # (3. click browse button at "File path for SINGLE FILE" to choose the targeted file or "Directory for MULTIPLE FILES" to choose directory containing targeted .tiff files.)

[//]: # (4. Adjust the parameters &#40;direction of the stack, stiffness, filter size, offset, depth&#40;optional&#41;&#41;)

[//]: # (5. click OK  to start the projection process)

[//]: # (6. Output folder&#40;s&#41; is created at the same directory of the input .tiff file&#40;s&#41;)

[//]: # (7. Output includes: Maximum Intensity projected Image&#40;MIP&#41;, MIP corresponding z_map, Smooth Manifold MIP-based projected image&#40;SMP&#41;, SMP corresponding z_map; if depth parameter is not 0, SMP-adjusted projected image and corresponding z_map)

[//]: # (## Features:)

[//]: # (### Process Mode:)

[//]: # (**Single File**: Process only 1 file or 1 file with additional channels)

[//]: # (**Multiple Files**: Process multiple files or multiple files with respective additional channels for the same parameter set)

[//]: # (**Interactive**: used for parameter tuning, processed Image is shown in new window and updated when parameters are adjust the result are not saved; this is to ensure fast process and update.)

[//]: # (### Direction of Z-Stack:)

[//]: # (The Z-stack slices are ordered based on the Z-position in the 3D space.)

[//]: # (**IN**: Top-to-Bottom: When the slices are taken from the top of the sample to the bottom, the Z-stack increases in value as you go deeper.)

[//]: # (**OUT**: When the slices are taken from the bottom of the sample to the top.)

[//]: # (### Stiffness:)

[//]: # (This is the constraint for the minimum distance between consecutive peaks.)

[//]: # (In the Smooth manifold process, signal peak is selected based on the distance with the nearest neighbor peaks.)

[//]: # (High intensity peaks have higher priority.)

[//]: # (The higher the stiffness, the fewer peaks are selected; result in less noisy projected image but also fewer details.)

[//]: # (### Filter Size:)

[//]: # (Filter size for Gaussian smoothing filters to reduce noise after the raw smoothing process.)

[//]: # (### Offset:)

[//]: # (Number of steps to be moved after applied offset; used to move the projected image up the surface or deep in the sample)

[//]: # (### Depth:)

[//]: # (Number to slices counting from the current smp slice to be performed MIP.)

[//]: # (The higher the offset, the more detail from neighboring slice is capture.)

[//]: # (This parameter is needed to be tuned for optimal result.)

[//]: # (### Directory for MULTIPLE FILES:)

[//]: # (Choose the directory for MULTIPLE_FILE MODE)

[//]: # (### File path for SINGLE FILE:)

[//]: # (Choose the file path for SINGLE_FILE MODE)

[//]: # (### Project Additional channels:)

[//]: # (Tick this if the smp z-map is used to applied for other channels of the same sample or image with the exact same dimension of the main channel.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (**IMPORTANT**: Additional channel images must be in a "Channels" folder &#40;the folder with the exact name "Channels"&#41;, located alongside the main channel image.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (### Additional channel directory:)

[//]: # (SINGLE_FILE and Additional channels: specify the sample folder)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (MULTIPLE_FILES and Additional channels: specify the parent folder&#40;the folder contains multiple sample Folders&#41;)
